# Hello, I am Mindaugas from Lithuania.
I have always had passion for seeking best
solution in different situations in life: evaluating
current situation and then making decisions
according to conditions, known-information.
This excitement for process of analysis and
interpretation has led me to Vilnius Coding School
where recently I have finished Data Analytics
course.
I learned to work with tools / technologies like SQL,
Power BI and Python.
I also have a passion for cyber security, which I am always interested in.
